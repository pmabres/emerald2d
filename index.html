<p>Javascript framework for 2d Games</p>

<p>Hello and thanks for reading. (If anyone does read this...)
This project is intended for developing 2d games with ECS pattern.
This project was initially named EmeraldJs but there are so many options out there that end with Js that im getting tired of Xjs naming.
This is a work in progress, (i've just has started). The main idea is to have a fully functional framework that allows anyone to extend it by adding custom components and link them to entities.
I've based my idea from using Unity3d.
Why would i create something similar to unity3d for developing 2d games?. For learning purposes really =).
In the future i plan to release an online IDE that will help on the creation process.
I aim to allow the most begginer developer, to be able to start making 2d games with something really intuitive, and fast.
This framework is just a tiny part of a future set of tools that i plan to make (whenever i got time). </p>

<p>Here is a list of features intended to reach on each release:

<p>The features will be updated as long as i complete them and i will be pushing everything to each respective branch.</p>

<p>Greetings, Francisco.</p>
