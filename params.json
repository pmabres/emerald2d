(If anyone does read this...)\r\nThis project is intended for developing 2d games with ECS pattern.\r\nThis project was initially named EmeraldJs but there are so many options out there that end with Js that im getting tired of Xjs naming.\r\nThis is a work in progress, (i've just has started). The main idea is to have a fully functional framework that allows anyone to extend it by adding custom components and link them to entities.\r\nI've based my idea from using Unity3d.\r\nWhy would i create something similar to unity3d for developing 2d games?. For learning purposes really =).\r\nIn the future i plan to release an online IDE that will help on the creation process.\r\nI aim to allow the most begginer developer, to be able to start making 2d games with something really intuitive, and fast.\r\nThis framework is just a tiny part of a future set of tools that i plan to make (whenever i got time). \r\n\r\nHere is a list of features intended to reach on each release:\r\nhttps://trello.com/b/45joLAOz/emerald2d\r\n\r\nThe features will be updated as long as i complete them and i will be pushing everything to each respective branch.\r\n\r\nGreetings, Francisco.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
